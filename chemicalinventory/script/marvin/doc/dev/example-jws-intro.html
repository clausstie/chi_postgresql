<h1>Java<sup>TM</sup> Web Start Example - Introduction</h1>
<ul>
<li><h2>Java<sup>TM</sup> Web Start</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
Java<sup>TM</sup> Web Start is a new technology for deploying applications -- it gives you the power to launch full-featured applications with a single click from your Web browser. You can download and launch applications, such as a program for drawing or sketching chemical structures, without going through complicated installation procedures.<br>
<br>
With Java Web Start, you launch applications simply by clicking on a Web page link. If the application is not present on your computer, Java Web Start automatically downloads all necessary files. It then caches the files on your computer so the application is always ready to be relaunched anytime you want -- either from an icon on your desktop or from the browser link. And no matter which method you use to launch the application, the most current version of the application is always presented to you.<br>
<br>
More information is available on <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/" target="_blank">Sun's</a> site.

</blockquote>
<li><h2>Size of downloadable file</h2>
<blockquote>
Since Java<sup>TM</sup> Web Start runs applications, the <code>MarvinBeans.jar</code> file will be downloaded when a user launches MarvinSketch or MarvinView. The size of this <code>jar</code> file is larger than the sizes of applets.
</blockquote>
<li><h2>Compatibility</h2>
<blockquote>
Our Java Web Start applications run only in browsers that have Java 2 Runtime Environment 1.3 or later installed.
