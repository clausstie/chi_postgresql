<A NAME="introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
MarvinSpace is a Java-based 3-dimensional molecular structure visualization
program. Its main purpose is to display macromolecules including
proteins, nucleic acids, and protein-ligans complexes. MarvinSpace
is an interactive program, which means that it does not merely display a
static image but it allows the user to manipulate the structure: look at it from
different aspects, various distances, look inside etc.<br>
MarvinSpace can also be used to display and manipulate small molecules,
particularly if high quality rendering is required.
</p>

<p>MarvinSpace is built on OpenGL, the industry standard 3D visualization
language to render high quality molecular scenes. Beside high image quality,
OpenGL also provides efficiency that allows real-time manipulation of
molecular structures. OpenGL supports hardware acceleration, that is, it can
fully exploit the capabilities of the particular graphics card being used. </p>

<A NAME="canvas"></A><h3>Canvas</h3>

<p>
The canvas (or scene) is the image area that displays the molecular structures
in 3D. This is also an area that accepts mouse input events, like mouse motion
and mouse button clicks. These events are processed by the canvas and it reacts
to them in a predefined manner (though the default behaviour can be
<a href="#controlstab">changed easily</a>).

<a name="menubar"></a><h3>Menu Bar</h3>

<p>The main menu bar is located at the top of the MarvinSpace window. It consists
of four submenus: <B>File</B>, <B>Display</B>,
<B>Cells</B> and <B>Help</B>.</p>

<a name="filemenu"></a><h4>File menu</h4>

<p>The main function provided in the <B>File</B> submenu is
loading molecular structure files. These can
either be small molecules or a macromolecules (that is, proteins, protein-ligand
complexes, RNA, DNA etc). <br>
The structure opened is displayed in the current <a href="#cellsmenu">cell</a>
(marked by a thin red frame) and
is registered in the selection panel on the right
<!--
is registered in the <a href="selectionPanel">selection panel</a> on the right
-->
hand side of the MarvinSpace window.
</p>

<p>There are two alternative ways to load new structures in MarvinSpace.
<B>Open</b> removes all existing objects (after confirmation)
and loads new structures in either one or mre cells depending on user selection.
</br>
In constrast to this, <B>Add</b> keeps all previously loaded
structures and adds new ones to the current cell.</p>

<!--kep ide!-->

<p><B>Exit</B> leaves the program.</p>


<a name="displaymenu"></a><h4>Display menu</h4>

<p>Submenus and options in the display menu allow to change the drawing
style, the coloring scheme and further properties of components
displayed. Classes of components can have different settings, for instance the atom
colors of proteins and that of ligands can be set independently. <br>
However, there are global parameters too, like the fog effect and anti-aliasing, that affect all
visible components.
</P>

<p>Display settings are applied to all visible components of the corresponding
category, that is, if the draw type of ligands is changed to spacefill, then
all ligands are drawn this way, that is, with large atom spheres.</p>

<a name="drawtypemenu"></a><h4><B>Draw type</b> submenu</h4>

<p>Component type specific visualization mode can be selected in this submenu.
Six further submenus are available: Ligand, Protein, Water, Ion, Pharmacophore and
Surface. Note, that Protein refers to all macromolecules not only proteins but
nucleic acid polymers too.
Also note, that not all visualization modes are available for all kinds of components.</P>

                are drawn, too.<br>
                Note, that MarvinSpace 1.0-alpha is not capable of generating
                hydrogens not described in input files in the case of
                macromolecules. However, small molecules (excluding ligands
                in complexes) are automatically "hydrogenized". </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p>Note, that <B>Ligand</b> draw type is applied to all small
molecules, not only to ligands of protein-ligand complexes.</p>

<p>The next submenu, <B>Protein</b>, offers all modes
available for ligand drawing plus two further options.</P>

<p><B>
Secondary structure</b> represents the secondary structure of protein components
by a schematic diagram. Helixes are drawn as pipes (that is, sequences of
cylinders), sheets are represented by "planks" (that is, thin boxes), the
main chain of the protein (including turns) are represented by sticks connecting
C<sub>&alpha;</sub> atoms.<br>
Note, that further representations of the secondary structure including ribbon
and cartoon will also be available in future releases of MarvinSpace.</p>


<p><B>Labels on selection</b> is a temporary implementation
of displaying atom labels. If this box is checked the residue atom
label of the selected atoms are displayed next to the atom. The residue atom
label consists of the residue name (3 letter abbreviation in the case of amino
acids, or 1 letter code in the case of nucleic acids), the residue sequence number,
the chain identifier and the atom label.<br>
Note, that further labels will also be available and alternative ways to display
label will also be implemented in next versions of MarvinSpace.
</p>

<p>The next submenu, <B>Water</b> allows to specify the
representation of water molecules defined in PDB files. Three types are
available. By default the oxygen atom of the water molecule is drawn in wire
mode: a small cross is placed at the atom center. <B>Ball</b>
and <B>Spacefill</b> can also be selected, but again, in
these modes too, only the oxygen atom of the water molecule is displayed.</P>

<p><B>Ion</b> sets the display mode of ions defined in PDB files, the
same options are available as for water molecules, though the default draw
type is <B>Spacefill</b>.</p>

<p>The <B>Pharmacophore</b> submenu offers three display modes,
<B>Solid</b>, <B>Wire</b> and
<B>Transparent</b>. <!--Read more about pharmcophore
representantion <a href="pharmacophore">here</a>--></P>.

<p>The last submenu in <B>Draw type</b> is
<B>Surface</b>. Three draw types are available:
<B>Dot</b>, <B>Mesh</b> and
<B>Solid</b>. This latter can be used in combination with
transparency when the <B>Transparent</b> box is checked.</p>

<p>Ions can be colored by constant or by CPK colors. <br>
In case of surfaces the four types introduced for proteins are available, and a
fifth option can also be selected: <B>Electrostatic potential</b>
that calculates electrostatic potential value for surface points and colors the
surface according to the current value at a given surface point. Negative
potential is colored by blue while positive potential values are represented by
red. The intensity of colors varies according to the absolute value of the
electrostatic potential.
The coloring can <a href="#dynamicsurfacecolor">dynamically be adjusted</a>
independtly for negative and for positive values.</p>



<a name="surfacemenu"></a><h4><B>Surface</b> submenu</h4>

<p>There are four types of molecular surfaces available in MarvinSpace: Connolly,
van der Waals, solvent accessible and blobby. Blobby moleclue is yet experimental.</p>


<a name="qualitymenu"></a><h4><B>Quality</b> submenu</h4>

<p>Three display qualities are provided by MarvinSpace: <B>High</b>,
<B>Medium</b> and <B>Low</b>.
Apparently, <B>High</b> gives the nicest and smoothest
representation, while <B>Low</b> enables the highest
performance, thus this is the most suitable for slow graphic cards. The rendering
quality is primarily determined by the number of triangles constituting atom
sphere and bond cylinders for structure display. In the case of surfaces the
resolution of a discrete grid in which the surface is approximated correlates with
 the rendering quality. The corresponding parameters are
wired in and cannot be changed by the user. Future version of MarvinSpace
will provide a dialog in the GUI to let the user tweak these parameters according
to needs and the performance of the graphic card.</p>

<p>Rendering quality autoscaling mechanism is also implemented, though in MarvinSpace 1.0-alpha
this is still experimental. Autoscaling decreases the current display quality
with respect to the actual performance of the graphics hardware (expressed as
frame rate). For instance anti-aliasing is automatically turned off when a molecular
scene is manipulated (rotated, translated, zoomed), though when no further mouse
events are encountered anti-alising is automatically turned on again.</p>


<a name="fog"></a><h4><B>Depth cue</b> menu item</h4>

<p>Depth cue is often referred to as the fog effect. When this option is selected
the molecular scene is drawn as if it was placed in a foggy atmosphere which
results in displaying distant parts of the molecules with faded, blurred colors while
near parts are brighter with sharper edges. This gives a good impression of depth
that allows better recognize the 3D structure.</p>


<a name="antialias"></a><h4><B>Anti-alias</b> menu item</h4>

<p>Antialising smooths all objects displayed that results in smoother edges,
less ragged lines, more realistic intersections. However, this function
is very costly and the quality highly depends on the graphic hardware.<br>
Note, that anti-aliased scene cannot be manipulated (rotated, zoomed etc)
therefore a built in mechanism called quality auto scaling, unique to MarvinSpace,
automatically turns off antialising for moving images and turned it back when
image is standing still.</p>


<a name="options"></a><h4><B>Options</b> menu item</h4>

<p>This menu item pops up a dialog window to set various rendering parameters.
These are as follows.</p>

<p>The MarvinSpace canvas can be subdivided into rectangular areas called cells.
Each cell can contain arbitrary number of structures. Each cell is fully
functional, that is, the same actions can be performed per cell as for an
undivided canvas.</p>

<A NAME="popupmenu"></A><h3>Pop-up Menu</h3>
<P>The pop-up menu appears when you <a href="#customstyle">right-click</a> over
the canvas. Functions available in this menu will significantly change in
future releases. In version 1.0-alpha the first item,
<B>Best fit</b>, works well in all cases. This sets zoom ratio
and view angle to optimal values to allow to see the entire content of the current cell (where
right mouse button was pressed) regardless of the size and the number of structures displayed
in that cell.</P>


<a name="toolbar"></a><h3>Toolbar</h3>

<p>The toolbar is located under the Main menu bar and it consists of small
icon buttons. These allow to access functions not available in menus. (Note,
that future releases of MarvinSpace will make all functions available from
dedicated submenus too, and the toolbar will be user configurable.)<br>
There are various classes of functions available as tools, such as monitors, controls,
pharmacophores and other display tools.</p>


<a name="monitors"></a><h4>Monitors</h4>

<p>These tools enable to measure  geometric properties of molecules in
an interactive fashion. Distances (bond lengths or any interatomic distances),
bond angles and dihedral angles can be measured. Results are displayed in
monitors that are small labels on the canvas linked to the structure. When the
structure is rotated these monitors move along, and when the structures are
manipulated by <a href="#controls">controls</a> monitors are refreshed
automatically to reflect any changes in the geometry of the structures instantly.</p>

<p>Monitors are easy to use: select the tpe of monitor appropriate for the
property to be measured (ie. distance, bond angle, dihedral angle), then
select the appropriate number of atoms one by one (single click with left mouse
button). When the last atom (ie. second, third or fourth depending on the
type of monitor) is selected the monitor appears on the canvas.</P>

<!--kep ide!!!!-->

<p>Monitors themselves can be selected by single click of left mouse button just like any
other component visible on the canvas. When selected, they can be deleted (ie.
removed forever), and they can also be hidden (ie. removed from the canvas
temporarily). Hidden monitors can be shown again, use the right mouse button
<a href="#popupmenu">pop-up menu</a>.</p>


<a name="controls"></a><h4>Controls</h4>

<p>Controls are tools that can manipulate the internal and absolute coordinates or other
geometrical properties of the selected objects. Three controls are available:
translate, rotate and resize. The latter, resize, can only be applied to
elements of <a href="#pharmacophore">pharmacophore models</a>. <p>

<p>The translate control moves the selected object and changes its coordinates, thus the
relative position of two (or more) objects (e.g. two ligands in the same
binding pocket) can be modified. To translate a molecule follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Select the structure in the selection panel: click onit with the left mouse button</li>
    <li>click right button to get the pop-up menu</li>
    <li>choose first item, <B>Select</b>, atom's of the
        selected structure become highlighted</li>
    <li>now press the translate control button <!--KEP IDE!!!!--> in the toolbar</li>
    <li>drag the selected object: hold down the left mouse button plus press
        the <B>Ctrl</b> (control) key on the keybord and
        move the mouse</li>
</ol>

<p>Note, however, that this way the selected object can be translated in the
plane of the screen only. In order to move it in other directions, that is, along
the third axis towards viewer's eyes or away from them, the <B>Shift</b>
key has to be pressed too. <br>
Note that rotation and translation of the scene is always possible, regardless of
which monitor or control is being applied.</p>

<p>The next control button is the rotation control. With this the selected
structure can be rotated without affecting any other object. For instance a ligand in a proteins binding
pocket can be rotated while the  protein
remains in its original position. To rotate the selected object follow the steps
of translation described above, except that in the 4th step press the rotate <!--KEP IDE!!!-->
control button instead of the translate button. Note, that the
<B>Ctrl</b> (control) key on the keybord has to be held down to
rotate the selected object, otherwise the scene is rotated (thus no coordinates,
relative positions of objects changes).<br>
If both <B>Ctrl</b> (control) and
<B>Shift</b> keys are presed, the object rotates about
the axis perpendicular to the plane of the canvas.
</P>

<p>The resize control can be applied to increase/decrease the size of spheres
and arrows used in <a href="#pharmacophore">pharmacophore model building</a>.
This works similar to translation nd rotation, though in this case the
object to be selected is either a pharmacophore sphere or an arrow. Again, the
<B>Ctrl</b> (control) key has to pressed to resize the
selected object.</p>

<a name="pharmacophore"></a><h4>Pharmacophore model building</h4>

<p>MarvinSpace offers a simple tool to represent pharmacophore models: spheres
and arrows can be placed at any position. These can be translated, rotated and
resized using controls.<br>
To place a pharmacophore sphere to represents a pharmacophoric point
follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
    <li>press the pharmacophore sphere button KEP IDE</li>
    <li>click on an arbitrary atom: a sphere appears around the
        selected atom</li>
</ol>

<p>Arrows can be placed the same way except that the arrow button has to be
pressed to initiate the process. </p>


<a name="displaytools"></a><h4>Display tools</h4>

<p>Display tools enhance the visualization capabilities of MarvinSpace. With these
the user can have better understanding of the structures studied.<br>
The <B>Depth cue</b> (or Fog) tool enhances the sensation
of space (depth) by fading distant objects. The fog can gradually be adjusted
by the <B>Depth cue</b> slider.</p>

<p>The <B>Clipping</b> slider moves a plane parallel with the
canvas towards or away from the visible objects. The plane cuts these object,
parts in front of the plane are not visible. This helps better understand the
structure being analyzed by allowing deeper insight into buried parts by hiding
obscuring details.</p>


<a name="dynamicsurfacecolor"></a><p>Finally, the tool for dynamic surface coloring
is more complex. In the present
release it can be used in combination with surfaces colored by electrostatic
potential. By moving the sliders the areas of the surface where the negativ/positive
potential is below/above the threshold values set by the slider are not colored
(i.e. colored by the default color).
The leftmost and rightmost edit boxes display the minimum/maximum potential
values calculated on the surface, while the two inner values correspond to
the actual positions of the slider in the [minimum, 0] and the [0, maximum] ranges, respectively.<br>
With this dynamic coloring modellers can better focus on areas where the
absolute value of the potential is above a certain threshold thus where
the chance for an electrostatic interaction is more likely.</p>
