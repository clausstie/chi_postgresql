    <h1>Proposal for chemical intelligent software solution: LabProject and LabInventory.</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>LabProject and LabInventory are proposed open-source initiatives initiated by the developers of the chemicalinventory.org project (Visit http://www.chemicalinventory.org).
	</p>

	<p><strong><em>(The names LabProject and LabInventory are working titles, final names will be defined soon.)</em></strong></p>

<p><b>LabInventory:</b> Based on the experiences from the chemicalinventory project, this part will be full scale chemical inventory, including structure search, label print, barcode handling, container and compound creation and manipulation… etc… This part will focus only on the inventory job necessary to keep track of chemicals.</p>

<p><b>LabProject: </b>This is intended to be a study, sample and research data management application. This will manage information created during research and analysis of samples<b>.</b>The target is to make the application the leading open source program for handling study, sample and research data in academic environments. The project lay out will be created together with interested academic institutions and universities world wide. <br></p><p>The two applications will be created to interact seamlessly, giving the experience of working in a single application for the end user. <br></p><h2>Background</h2><p> 
The chemicalinventory project has now been offered as an open source project for approx. 3 years. The application was initially started 5 years ago, and the time has come to upgrade the solution. <br></p><p>The project is currently implemented at a number of academic institutions, and has received only positive feedback. <br></p><p>Based on the experience with this project, and an actual need we believe that the academic world is ready for a serious solution for managing the vast amount of data created during research projects. <br></p><h2>Description <br></h2><p>The primary goal for these projects is to create a single point of access for inventory, study, sample and research data created in your organization. <br></p><p>The data can be created from chemical, biological or microbiological research or analysis. <br></p><p>Specifications for functionality are set to be created in collaboration with universities and other organizations interested in this project. This work will start as soon as the first interested parties have been identified. <br></p><p>The LabInventory and LabProject will share data model ensuring that data can be easily shared between these two applications. <br></p><h2>Plan</h2><p> 
This project will be created in three steps. <br></p><p><u><strong>Step 1</strong></u> will be to port the current chemicalinventory application to a new flexible user interface and data model. The data model will be designed, to easily be expanded to support the integration of the sample and research data part of the project. The specification of this application will be the current chemicalinventory application, with addition of any new suggestions and ideas from participants. (Time frame 3-6 months) <br></p><p><u><strong>Step 2</strong></u> will be specification and design of the LabProject initiative. This step will be conducted parallel with step 1. (Time frame approx. 1-3 months depending on the input from participants) <br></p><p><u><strong>Step 3</strong></u> will be the implementation of the specified LabProject application.(Time frame: First functional release approx. 6 months) <br></p><p>(Time frames are approximately and for full time work.) <br></p><p>Parallel with these steps work will be initiated to created all documentations, this including user guides and tutorials. <br></p><h2>Participating &amp; Funding <br></h2><p>To ensure the functionality of the application will meet the actual needs of the academic community, it is vital that universities and others participate in the specification of the applications. <br></p><p>To register as interested in the project and potentially take part in the specification part, or to register as interested in giving financial support for these projects send an email to <strong><em>info@chemicalinventory.org</em></strong>. <br></p><p>The aim for the projects is to make them a full time open source project. This is vital to minimize the development time for the applications. The only way this can be achieved is by interested parties also financially supporting these initiatives. <br></p><p>After a development period the project will be continued as a commercial open source project. Here the application itself will be released as open source. Support, hosting, and customization will hereafter be offered at small monthly fees. <br></p><h2>Technical Stuff <br></h2><p>The developers are skilled in several modern programming languages. The choice for this project will initially be Java (J2EE) based. Both applications will be created using the JSF framework, and we will include modern technologies like AJAX, to enhance the user interface experience.<br> 
Supported database will most likely initially be MySQL since this has become the de facto open source standard choice, but applications will be created to be database engine independent. <br></p><p>The applications will be created with full support for firefox and ie, and will be serverside platform independent. <br></p><h2>Further informatinon<br></h2><p>Go to <em><strong>http://www.chemicalinventory.org/proposal</strong></em> for the latest information on this proposal.</p><p><br></p><p><b>
