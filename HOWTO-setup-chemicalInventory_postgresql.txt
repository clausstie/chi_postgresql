HOWTO setup chemicalinventory - Claus Stie Kallesøe and Dann Vestergaard 2007
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated by Claus Stie Kallesøe, 2013, to reflect the port to postgresql
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following text is supposed to be a help to install the chemicalInventory system. The setup of
PostgreSQL, JAVA and Tomcat depends on the OS and is described very well at many other sites so we
will skip that here and expect that the Tomcat servlet container, the postgreSQL Database and JAVA 
is installed and running on your system.


What is needed
---------------

The following software is needed (assuming you have hardware with an OS and some disc space)
in order to make the system work:

1) Postgresql to hold the data (Many other databases can most likely be used but in that case 
you need to edit the way we communicate with the database - another JDBC driver)

2) A mysql-connector-java driver to be able to communicate with the database from the javabeans.

3) Tomcat as servlet container (Again you might make it work with other tools but we have only
used Tomcat).

4) JAVA. You need a J2SDK in order to load the servlet container and to compile the .java
files if/when you edit them

5) The JChem JAVA library and the Marvin applets from ChemAxon (www.chemaxon.com). The library
handles the registration of and searching in the structures and the applets gives us the
structure drawing tools. You can get a free academia license to all these tools if you ....yes
if you are academia!


Platform support
-------------------

All the above mentioned tools are available on a large number of platforms so in theory
chemicalInventory should run on all of them, but we cannot be sure. We have had the system
running on Mac OS X, Linux (Debian, RedHat, Slackware, Ubuntu) and Windows so there is a fair chance
that your OS will work as well.


What to do
-----------

1) MySql 

Install and setup your MySql database and make sure it is working.
Create a user who will own the chemicalInventory tables. 

The default is: 

schema name = chemicals
user name = chemicals
password = chemicals

Give the user privileges to the chemicals database.

The name of the database to use, is specified in two places. - Under tomcat/conf/server.xml (see tomcat setup)
and under tomcat/webapps/chemicalinventory/WEB-INF/configuration/CIConfiguration.txt (see section 2)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CHANGE THE DEFAULT VALUES, BUT REMEMBER TO ALSO DO IT IN THE CONFIGURATION FILES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the sql script shipped with chemicalInventory in order to setup the required tables.
The script will also setup the structure tables required by the JChem library.

A default user "Administrator" with password "master" is created.

------------------------


2) Tomcat

Install and setup Tomcat and make sure it is running (that you see the default Welcome page in
a webbrowser).

Copy the chemicalInventory.war file you downloaded into the Tomcat webapps directory make sure 
the name of the war file is chemicalinventory.war.

Should look something like this:

/where_ever_your_tomcat_is_located/webapps/chemicalinventory.war

Restart the Tomcat server and point your webbrowser to
http://serverip:port/chemicalinventory

This will unpack the chemicalinventory.war file and give you a chemicalinventory directory:

/where_ever_your_tomcat_is_located/webapps/chemicalinventory

Copy the content in /chemicalinventory/text/CI_context_tomcat5.txt (For tomcat 5.5) or
/chemicalinventory/text/CI_context_tomcat5.txt (For tomcat 5.0 and 4.1) to the server.xml file placed in
/where_ever_your_tomcat_is_located/conf/server.xml. Alter the values if your
system is different from the default values. This should be placed just before the last </HOST> tag.

Modify the chemicalinventory configuration file located under 
/where_ever_your_tomcat_is_located/webapps/chemicalinventory/WEB-INF/configuration/CIconfiguration.txt
with values relevant for your setup.

---------------------------------

3) mysql-connector-java

After Tomcat has unpacked the war file a recomended version of the mysql connecter can be found:
Tomcat/webapps/chemicalinventory/text/mysql-connector-java-3.1.12-bin.jar.

Copy mysql-connector to /wherever_your_tomcat_is_located/common/lib

--------------------------------

4) JChem library and the Marvin applets

The chemicalinventory is bundled with JChem version 3.1.6 and the marvin applets. The default licence
is 1 (=one) structure search pr. minute. Contact www.chemaxon.com for further licence privileges.

--------------------------------


5) You are ready to rock and roll!

All you need to do is restart the Tomcat server and point your webbrowser to

http://serverip:port/chemicalinventory

and you should see the beatifull front end of the application.

----------------------------------

6) Tomcat 5.0.X and 4.1.x 
----------------------------------

If you want to use the application together with privious versions of tomcat, it has 
been tested on tomcat 5.X and tomcat 4.1.31.

If you want to use tomcat 5.0.X or 4.1.X the following changes must be made:

1. replace the tomcat/webapps/WEB-INF/web.xml with the file placed in tomcat/webapps/chemicalinventory/text/web_tomcat4_1.xml
and rename it to web.xml.

2. the server.xml for tomcat must use the ci_context_tomcat4_1.txt. Place the content of this file
just before the last </HOST> tag in this file.


What if it doesn't work
-----------------------

If it doesn't work - then go back and check you have performed the steps described here. If it
still doesn't work you can mail us on Sourceforge, or user info@chemicalinventory.or and we will try to help you

Should you later change the code and improve the software we much appreciate if you will let us
know

Have fun
